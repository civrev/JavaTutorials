this is an alternate version of the display. It allows for displaying all the voters at once in a table.
Voter.java goes in model, not view, like the other two. I had to rewrite the entire voter model,
which is okay because I bypassed it entirely anyways in my program rewrite. This new model is strickly for displaying the table.
